# Data Engineering Case Studies

Welcome to my data engineering portfolio. This repository contains hands-on case studies that showcase my ability to build and manage modern data pipelines using cloud-native tools and open-source technologies.

Each project is designed to reflect real-world data challenges and demonstrates how I apply best practices in data engineering — from streaming ingestion to analytics-ready data models.

### 1. Kafka → AWS Lambda → Snowflake Pipeline
Simulates a real-time data ingestion and transformation workflow:
- Kafka (self-hosted) produces clickstream data
- AWS Lambda-style function (Python) transforms events
- Snowflake handles final storage using secure ingestion
- Includes Docker, test data, and step-by-step instructions

### 2. DBT + Snowflake Analytics Stack
A complete dbt project demonstrating:
- Raw-to-staging-to-marts modeling
- Tests, documentation, and Jinja-based logic
- Example use case: Ecommerce customer orders and payments
